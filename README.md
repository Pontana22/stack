# stack
stack is a simple, easy to use tool for converting any reasonable number of items into stacks and items instead of having to use a calculator or some website. It is also the only stack calculator that will insult the user if they're being an idiot.

stack is intended for use when playing Minecraft, but could really be used for anything with base 64

## How to use

### Installation

#### Windows
- Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/Pontana22/stack/releases) and download the latest executable
- Run the executable and follow the instructions

#### Other OS / own installation
Just download stack.py and run it however you like

### Usage
Simply run the program and enter anything into the terminal. If a reasonable number (any integer greater than 64) is entered, the program will print the corresponding number of stacks and items. If anything else is entered (including nothing), the program will print one of 50 different insults, usually targeting your intellect. 

## Idk I thought it was interesting
The program will randomly cycle through all 50 insults before starting over, which means that the odds of the same insult being picked two times in a row is 0.04%
