# stack
stack is a simple, easy to use tool for converting any reasonable number of items into stacks and items instead of having to use a calculator or some website. It is also the only stack calculator that will insult the user if they're being an idiot.

stack is intended for use when playing Minecraft, but could really be used for anything with base 64

## How to use

### Installation

#### Windows
- Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/Pontana22/stack/releases) and download the latest installer
- Run the installer and follow the instructions

#### Other OS / own installation
Just download stack.py and run it however you like

### Usage
Simply run the program and enter anything into the terminal.

#### Responses
The program will respond in a couple differnt ways depending on what is entered:

- If a reasonable number (any integer greater than 64) is entered, the corresponding number of stacks and items will be printed
- If "help" (case insensitive) is entered, a short explanation of the program's basic function is printed
- If "stop", "exit", "quit" or "fuck off" (all case insensitive) is entered, the program will terminate
- If anything else is entered (including nothing), one of 50 different insults will be printed, usually targeting your intellect

## Idk I thought it was interesting
The program will randomly cycle through all 50 insults before starting over, which means that the odds of the same insult being picked two times in a row is 0.04%
